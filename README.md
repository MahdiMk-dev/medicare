> A web app for requesting any home medical service, so that people living alone or those who need continuous medical care can get treated well at home with 24/7 service.
>
> Elder people living alone find it hard sometimes to take good care of the their medical issues, or even people with chronic cases who need continuous medical care face a lot of issues. This project aims to help these people secure all kind of medical services (private nurses,medical supplies, medical consulation, lab samples, etc..) around the clock while they're at home.

### User Stories

- As a patient, I want to have a live chat with a medical admin to get help with specific services/medical opinions, so that I can benefit the most from the application.
- As a patient, I want to request medical services, so that I can get the needed care at home.
- As a patient, I want to get a brief quick analysis of my results, so that I can know if I should do something or contact someone urgently.
- As a staff, I want to get email with my schedule so that I don't miss any schedule task.
- As a staff, I want to have access over my patients' profiles, so that I can provide good care.
- As an admin, I want to have full access over the system, so that I can provide good management of human and medical resources.
- As an admin, I want to assign staff to newly received requests.
- As an admin, I want to have live chat with any patient, so that I can give any urgent comment and for better communication securing high quality of service.

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title3.svg"/>

### Medicare is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
